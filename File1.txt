the algorithm takes care to create text that looks similar to an ordinary book but without any real meaning. the reason we want our text to be meaningless is that we want the person viewing the resulting random text to focus on the design we are presenting, rather than try to read and understand the text.

it's better than lorem ipsum because it can produce text in many languages and in particular: chinese, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, greek, hebrew, italian, japanese, latin, polish, portuguese, russian, serbian and spanish.
